## Overview of the Project

## Project: To-Do List

## Objective
The objective of this To-Do List website is to provide users with a simple and user-friendly way to manage their daily tasks. The website allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks from a list. It is designed to be visually appealing with a professional interface that includes a background image and responsive design, making it usable on different devices.

## Key Activities
-Users can input new tasks in the text box and add them to the to-do list by clicking the "Add Task" button or pressing the "Enter" key.

-Each task can be marked as completed by clicking the green check button. Completed tasks are crossed out and given a different background color to visually distinguish them.

-Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the red delete button, allowing for easy management of their to-do list.

-The website layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
